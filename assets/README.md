# Dream-to-App Generator — SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) • Nigeria

This repo is a GitHub Pages-ready demo for the Vibe Coding Hackathon. It follows the hackathon template: focus areas, monetization (IntaSend), tools table, judging criteria, pitch criteria, and submission essentials.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new public GitHub repo and add these files.
2. Commit + push to `main`.
3. Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Branch: `main`, Folder: `/ (root)`.
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` and use that URL as your deployment link.

## What to include before submission
- Add `deck.pdf` (pitch deck) to repo root.
- Optional: add a short demo video link (≤ 2 mins) in README.
- Ensure README clearly explains how to run and where the live demo is.

## Notes on services
- **IntaSend**: recommended payments provider for African markets — integrate via a secure backend. Do not expose API keys in frontend.
- **AI APIs**: Use server-side calls for Hugging Face / OpenAI keys.

## Tips to win
- Deliver a working MVP demonstrating one clear flow.
- Keep the pitch concise: problem → solution → demo → impact.
- Provide clear README steps so judges can verify quickly.
